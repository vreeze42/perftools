Callgraph
=========
Make callgraph of AutoHotkey scripts. Maybe later also other languages. Idea is to
parse and put in SQLite db first, then use graphviz/html to present.

Other projects
==============
* AhkDoc: documentation generation based on comments in sourcefile. Maybe combine this script with AhkDoc.
* SourceDep: works for quite a lot of languages, but only on the file level (not functions). Build
  in ruby, but too OO centric.
* querydep
* onto2graph: ontology in Protege export to graph.
